# Hello, World!, I'm Nur Pratap! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building cool stuff. I thrive on learning new technologies, solving complex problems, and collaborating with others to create impactful solutions. I also love working on personal projects, exploring ideas, and diving deep into coding challenges.

### 🚀 What I'm working on:
- **Insurance Management System:** I'm currently building a scalable, secure, and efficient insurance management system where each company has isolated data access. I'm implementing strict data segregation logic to ensure secure access for companies, employees, agents, and customers.
- **Vechile  Management System:** Built a Vechile Management backend with seat Management, costumer tracking, bus tracking and notifications .
- **Personal Growth:** Always learning and improving. I'm reading books like *Atomic Habits*, *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and *The Art of Being Alone*. I focus on personal growth and understanding people, just as much as I do with tech.

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS, REST APIs, GraphQL
- **Others:** I like to stay on top of new trends in tech and use the best tools for the job!
- **System :** Kali Linux and Arch !

### 📚 Currently Learning:
- **Deep Dive into Insurance Industry & Brokerage Models** – working on creating innovative solutions in the insurance space.
- **Advanced Meditation Techniques** – exploring the link between mental clarity and creative coding. 🧘‍♂️

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
When I’m not coding, I love reflecting on "what if" scenarios, daydreaming about random events, and imagining detailed stories. I’m a big believer in staying true to my goals and the importance of support and collaboration in any venture.


- Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about code, life, or anything else! 😊
